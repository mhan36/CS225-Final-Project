# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings**
Team meeting will occur before and after CS225 labs, (the ones that take place from 3pm - 5pm). They will happen in person at Grainger Library, or over the Discord Group Chat. An additional meeting may take place if sufficient work was not completed.

2. **Assistance** 
Teamates are to contact each other through the Discord Group Chat. They are to respond when available. Generally within an hour, but in certain circumstances this may be a day or more. Group members are encouraged to Google questions before consulting the rest of the group, however others would be happy to help anyone who could not come up with an answer themselves.

3. **Respect** 
It is not that deep. We come from the same high school and know each other. Toxicity towards other group members will not be tolerated, and members are to handle disagreements amicably. Toxic behavior will be addressed by the other group members. Additionally, the text group chat format ensures that everybody is able to voice their opinions at any time.

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
Team members have similar expertise, so we will take on similar workloads. During the group meeting, each group member will be assigned a task to do over the course of the week to ensure that similar amounts of work are done. Unforseen work will be addressed in meeting by delegation or working together.

5. **Time Commitment** 
Group members are expected to contribute between three to five hours each week. We will try to get as much as possible out of the way before finals season, so that we have time to address those conflicts at that point.
    
6. **Conflict Resolution** 
As a group of three, there will always be a majority on any conflict. None of us have serious stake in the direction of the project, so we would probably accept majority opinion. If a member believes they will be unable to finish a task in the time provided, they should let the other members know as soon as possible to make the proper arrangements to ensure it gets done. Failing this, the workload gets redistributed over the next week.
